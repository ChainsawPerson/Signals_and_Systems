# Resources made by *me*Â©

## Includes:
- __Wav file:__ *panagiotis.wav* me saying my name in a 2 second recording using Matlab commands

- __Custom Image:__ *customImage.bmp* which is a black and white image of a dragon(*?*) painted in MSPaint and exported as a B&W .bmp file as specified in the exercise.



## How to:

- __Create my own *name.wav* using *only* Matlab:__ Open the file [*askisi1.m*](https://github.com/ChainsawPerson/Signals_and_Systems/blob/main/Lab/askisi1.m). In the source code, remove the **"%"** character at the beginning of lines 4-7. You can change the number in the **recordblocking()** command on line 5 to as many <ins>*seconds*</ins> as you want the audio to be. On line 7 you can change **"name"** in *"name.wav"* to whatever you want to name your audio file. __BE CAREFULL *NOT*__ to change the suffix *".wav"*. Execute lines 4-7 one by one or all together but be ready to start talking as soon as you execute line 5, because there is no warning when the recording starts.

After saving your audiofile make sure to comment out lines 4-7 so that you do not accidentally overwrite your audio file when these lines are executed. For the rest of your code make sure to make the apropriate changes to variable names if needed.

- __Create my own *customImage.bmp* using Microsoft Paint:__ Open Microsoft Paint and create your image in Black and White only. __(*Advice:* do not use brushes, use the pencil instead).__ When you are done drawing, save the drawing as a one color .bmp file to be sure that it only contains black and white.

If  you want, you can change the name of your custom image, but make sure to also change the variable names in the source code when needed.
