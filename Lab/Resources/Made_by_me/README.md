## Includes:
- __Wav file:__ *panagiotis.wav* me saying my name in a 2 second recording using Matlab commands

- __Custom Image:__ *customImage.bmp* which is a black and white image of a dragon(*?*) painted in MSPaint and exported as a B&W .bmp file as specified in the exercise.



## How to:

- __Create my own *user_name.wav* using *only* Matlab:__ Open the file [*askisi1.m*](https://github.com/ChainsawPerson/Signals_and_Systems/blob/main/Lab/askisi1.m). In the source code, remove the **"%"** character at the beginning of lines 4-7. You can change the number in the **recordblocking()** command on line 5 to as many <ins>*seconds*</ins> as you want the audio to be. On line 7 you can change **"name"** in *"name.wav"* to whatever you want to name your audio file. __BE CAREFULL *NOT*__ to change the suffix *".wav"*. Execute lines 4-7 one by one or all together but be ready to start talking as soon as you execute line 5, because there is no warning when the recording starts.
